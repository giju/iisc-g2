# Heal Sphere

We use data from a mental health survey to explore factors that may cause individuals to experience depression.
A model will be developed to predict if the person is undergoing depression and suggest activites to improve on mental health making use of Chat GPT.

## Steps to setup the project
- Clone the github repo / download the zip and unzip
- Create folder data and subfolders at top level as per the hierarchy shown above.
- Setup virtual environment for the project
- install packages using pip install -r requirements.txt
- Download the files from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e11/ and keep it the "data/external" folder use the same naming convension
- Run the 1.01.gij.prepare notebook to generate data splits
- Run the 1.02.gij.clean notebook to cleanup the data and genrate output 
- Run the 2.01.gij.eda notebook to generate reports and visualisations
